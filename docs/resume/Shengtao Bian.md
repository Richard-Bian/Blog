JD.com, Inc.

MLE Intern (NLP)

1. Replicating the simCSE model with Tensorflow2
2. Fine-tuning the simCSE model with JD's internal data
3. Participated in the product iteration of JD Industrial Brain, improving the accuracy of neural network retrieval from 76% to 97%.
4. Construct video-text cross-modal retrieval with CLIP model. Generate image text pairs from a large number of e-commerce product images with its descriptions and put them into CLIP for fine-tuning. Fill in the gaps of text-image search.



Hikvision Digital Technology Co.,Ltd.

MLE Intern (NLP)

1. Research on event extraction direction papers in finance, such as Doc2EDAG GIT, etc., and write algorithm reviews.
2. Research on methods of ultra-long text characterization, such as roformer, hierarchical decomposition position coding, etc. to let bert break the 512 character limit, reproduce the code and write a review of the algorithm.
3. Research and organize the algorithm direction of text matching, such as sbert simCSE esimCSE, etc., reproduce the code and write a review of the algorithm.



Sany Heavy Industry Co.,Ltd

MLE Intern (NLP)

1. Responsible for collating and cleaning Q&A pairs and entering them into the database.
2. Build inverted index of Q&A pairs with elasticsearch. Use elasticsearch to do similarity calculation at phrase level.
3. Use simbert to transform the standard questions and user questions in the question database into sentence vectors. Use faiss to store the standard question vectors and obtain the standard questions with similar semantics by cosine similarity calculation for the user's questions.
4. Combine the topk and score returned by the above two methods. Return the standard questions and answers from the Q&A database if they exceed the expectation threshold, and enter the questions with low similarity into the database of unfamiliar questions.
5. Fine-tune the original simbert pre-training model with self-produced data.
6. Entity relationship extraction based on self-generated data.
7. Store the extracted entities and relations in Neo4j to build the knowledge graph.
